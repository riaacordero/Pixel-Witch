### MECHANICS
The game players control  **Pixel the Witch** as she travels from one map to another to find her way home. The goal of each level is for Pixel to find the golden key to unlock a door to the next world/level. The world of Pixel Witch consists of two types of map: the sky and the underground; both of which are infested by mobs, the grim reapers, and obstacles such as the lava. The scoring system of the game is based on the gems Pixel may collect within the map or after eliminating the mobs. The game includes consumables that are used to advance Pixel's abilities. Pixel may consume either of the three potions: red, yellow, and blue, which gives her the corresponding abilities/power-ups: shield, attack, and jump. The potions can only be consumed one at a time. The torches may also be consumed by Pixel to permanently light up the dark underground maps.

### FEATURES
